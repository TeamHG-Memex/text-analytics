	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Johnathan Frazier, Appellant.







Lynn W.L. Fahey, New York, N.Y. (Denise A. Corsí of counsel), for
appellant.

Kenneth P. Thompson, District Attorney, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Leonard Joblove, Howard
B. Goodman, and Amanda Muros-Bishoff of counsel), for respondent.





Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Del
Giudice, J.), rendered April 5, 2010, convicting him of assault in the first degree and
criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing
sentence.

Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, (1) by vacating the conviction of
assault in the first degree and the sentence imposed thereon, and dismissing that count of
the indictment, and (2) by vacating the sentence imposed on the conviction of criminal
possession of a weapon in the second degree; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed,
and the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Kings County, for resentencing on the
conviction of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.

We agree with the defendant that the evidence was not legally sufficient to establish
his guilt of assault in the first degree under count four of the indictment, which is
predicated on the theory that the defendant caused serious physical injury to the
complainant by means of a handgun with intent to cause such injury to a different person
(see Penal Law § 120.10 [1]). The evidence was not legally
sufficient to establish that the defendant, as opposed to another shooter at the scene, fired
the bullet that caused the complainant's serious physical injury (see People v
Dlugash, 41 NY2d 725, 730-731 [1977]; People v Petrosino, 299 AD2d 851,
851-852 [2002]; People v King, 265 AD2d 678, 680 [1999]; People v
Alvarado, 262 AD2d 710, 711 [1999]; People v Darrow, 260 AD2d 928, 929
[1999]). The defendant was not charged under an accomplice theory with respect to
count four. Accordingly, the defendant's conviction of assault in the first degree and the
sentence imposed thereon must be vacated, and count four of the indictment must be
dismissed. Under the circumstances here, we also vacate the sentence imposed on the
conviction of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and remit the matter
to the Supreme Court, Kings County, for resentencing on that conviction (see
CPL 470.20 [3]; People v Cohen, 50 NY2d 908, 910 [1980]; People v
Stuart, 123 AD2d 46, 54 [1986]). We express no opinion as to the sentence to be
imposed.

In light of our determination, we need not reach the defendant's remaining
contentions. Dillon, J.P., Balkin, Miller and Maltese, JJ., concur.
