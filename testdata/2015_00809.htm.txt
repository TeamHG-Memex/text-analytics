	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Hellime Nasher, Appellant.





Robert S. Dean, Center for Appellate Litigation, New York (Nicolas
Schumann-Ortega of counsel), for appellant.

Helime Nasher, appellant pro se.

Robert T. Johnson, District Attorney, Bronx (Bari L. Kamlet of counsel), for
respondent.





Judgment, Supreme Court, Bronx County (David Stadtmauer, J.), rendered
December 21, 2010, convicting defendant, after a nonjury trial, of robbery in the second
degree, burglary in the third degree and criminal impersonation in the first degree, and
sentencing him to an aggregate term of 10 years, unanimously modified, as a matter of
discretion in the interest of justice, to the extent of reducing the sentence for the robbery
conviction to a term of eight years, resulting in a new an aggregate term of eight years,
and otherwise affirmed.

The verdict was based on legally sufficient evidence and was not against the weight
of the evidence (see People v
Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 348-349 [2007]). There is no basis for disturbing the
court's credibility determinations. The evidence established the element of force required
for the robbery conviction. The unlawful entry element of burglary was established by
evidence that defendant entered the nonpublic portion of a store. Defendant's argument
that this theory was unsupported by the indictment or otherwise invalid is unpreserved
and we decline to review it in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we reject
it on the merits.

Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims, including those raised in his pro
se brief, are unreviewable on direct appeal because they involve matters not reflected in,
or fully explained by, the record (see People v Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988];
People v Love, 57 NY2d 998 [1982]). Accordingly, since defendant has not
made a CPL 440.10 motion, the merits of the ineffectiveness claims may not be
addressed on appeal. In the alternative, to the extent the existing record permits review,
we find that defendant received effective assistance under the state and federal standards
(see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708, 713-714 [1998]; Strickland v
Washington, 466 US 668 [1984]). Defendant has not shown that counsel's conduct
of the case fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, particularly given
counsel's inability to [*2]consult with his client, who had
absconded and was tried in absentia. Defendant has also failed to establish that counsel's
conduct deprived defendant of a fair trial or affected the outcome of the case.

We find the sentence excessive to the extent indicated. Concur—Mazzarelli,
J.P., Sweeny, Moskowitz, DeGrasse and Manzanet-Daniels, JJ.
