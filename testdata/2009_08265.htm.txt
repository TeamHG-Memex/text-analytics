Zuhlke, Appellant.


—[*1]


Timothy P. Donaher, Public Defender, Rochester (William Clauss of counsel), for
defendant-appellant. Michael C. Green, District Attorney, Rochester (Geoffrey Kaeuper of
counsel), for respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Monroe County (Stephen R. Sirkin, A.J.),
rendered April 5, 2006. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of criminal
possession of a weapon in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the third
degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.

Memorandum: On appeal from a judgment convicting him, following a jury trial, of criminal
possession of a weapon in the second degree (Penal Law § 265.03 [former (2)]) and
criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree (§ 265.02 [former (4)]), defendant
contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the conviction because the People
failed to establish that he acted with the requisite intent for accomplice liability. We reject that
contention (see generally People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). Whether an
accessory shares the intent of a principal actor may be established by circumstantial evidence
(see generally People v Ozarowski, 38 NY2d 481, 489 [1976]; People v Johnson,
101 AD2d 684 [1984]).

Here, it is undisputed that defendant knew that the other individuals in the vehicle in which
he was a passenger planned to use the gun in an unlawful manner. The People presented
evidence, including defendant's sworn statement, from which the jury could reasonably infer that
defendant was a participant in the plan, from its inception, to acquire the gun and to locate an
individual who would act as the gunman. Contrary to the contention of defendant, evidence of
his flight from the scene of the shooting was admissible as circumstantial evidence of his
consciousness of guilt (see People v
Lendore, 36 AD3d 940 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 947 [2007]).

Finally, viewing the evidence in light of the elements of the crimes as charged to the jury (see People v Danielson, 9 NY3d
342, 349 [2007]), we conclude that the verdict is not against the weight of the evidence
(see generally Bleakley, 69 NY2d at 495). Present—Scudder, P.J., Smith, Carni,
Pine and Gorski, JJ.
