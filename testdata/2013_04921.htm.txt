	The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v Hani
Abuhamra, Appellant. (Appeal No. 1.)


—[*1]

Lipsitz Green Scime Cambria LLP, Buffalo (Timothy P. Murphy of counsel),
for defendant-appellant.

Frank A. Sedita, III, District Attorney, Buffalo (Nicholas T. Texido of counsel), for
respondent.



Appeal from a judgment of the Erie County Court (Thomas P. Franczyk, J.),
rendered July 13, 2010. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of
assault in the second degree (two counts), unlawful imprisonment in the second degree
and criminal contempt in the first degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously modified on
the law by directing that the definite sentence imposed on count four of the indictment
shall run concurrently with the determinate sentences imposed on the remaining counts
of the indictment and as modified the judgment is affirmed.

Memorandum: In appeal No. 1, defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him
following a jury trial of, inter alia, two counts of assault in the second degree (Penal Law
§ 120.05 [1], [2]) and one count of criminal contempt in the first degree (§
215.51 [b] [iv]). In appeal No. 2, defendant appeals from an order denying his motion
seeking to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10 on the ground that
he was denied effective assistance of counsel. As a preliminary matter, we conclude that
County Court properly denied defendant's CPL 440.10 motion without a hearing
inasmuch as "trial counsel, the only person who could have provided any material
information not already before the motion court, was deceased" (People v Cotto,
259 AD2d 288, 289 [1999], lv denied 93 NY2d 1002 [1999]). We also note that
defendant failed to support the motion with his own sworn allegations (see CPL
440.30 [1] [a]), but instead submitted an unsworn "affirmation." Nevertheless, because
the court did not make a finding adverse to defendant on that ground, we decline to use it
as a basis for affirming the order in appeal No. 2 (see People v Santana, 101 AD3d 1664, 1664 [2012], lv
denied 20 NY3d 1103 [2013]; see generally People v Concepcion, 17 NY3d 192, 194-196
[2011]).

We reject the contention of defendant, raised in each appeal, that he was denied
effective assistance of trial counsel. We agree with the court's determination on the CPL
440.10 motion that defendant's allegation that he withdrew his plea solely on the ground
that his attorney advised him that he would never be convicted at trial or, if convicted,
that he would not receive a state prison sentence, is contradicted by the record (see
CPL 440.30 [4] [d] [i]). We also agree [*2]with the
court's determination that there is no reasonable possibility that the allegation is true
(see CPL 440.30 [4] [d] [ii]). With respect to each of the remaining alleged
instances of ineffective assistance, we conclude that defendant failed to establish the lack
of a strategic basis for any of the alleged deficiencies (see generally People v
Rivera, 71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988]). We therefore conclude that the record
establishes that defendant received meaningful representation from trial counsel (see
generally People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]).

Defendant failed to preserve for our review his contention in appeal No. 1 that the
People did not promptly disclose certain documents, which he contends constitute
Brady material (see generally CPL 470.05 [2]). In any event, defendant's
contention is without merit inasmuch as the information was turned over as
Rosario material prior to jury selection and thus defendant had ample time to use
the information (see People v
Gonzalez, 89 AD3d 1443, 1444 [2011], lv denied 19 NY3d 973 [2012],
reconsideration denied 20 NY3d 932 [2012]).

We reject defendant's contention in appeal No. 1 that the sentence is unduly harsh
and severe. We nevertheless conclude that the sentence is illegal insofar as the court
directed that the definite sentence imposed on count four of the indictment shall run
consecutively to the determinate sentences imposed on counts one and two (see
Penal Law § 70.35; People v Still, 26 AD3d 816, 817 [2006], lv denied
6 NY3d 853 [2006]). Inasmuch as we cannot permit an illegal sentence to stand (see People v Stubbs, 96 AD3d
1448, 1450 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 1001 [2012]), we modify the
judgment in appeal No. 1 accordingly (see Still, 26 AD3d at 817). Finally, we
note that the certificate of conviction erroneously states that defendant is obligated to pay
restitution in the amount of $1,268.81, rather than $1,261.87, and therefore it must be
amended to correct the clerical error (see generally People v Saxton, 32 AD3d 1286, 1286-1287
[2006]). Present—Scudder, P.J., Peradotto, Lindley and Sconiers, JJ.
